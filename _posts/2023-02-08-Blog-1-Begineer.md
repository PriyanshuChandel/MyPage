If you're just starting out with coding, you may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available online. With so many programming languages, frameworks, and tools to choose from, it can be difficult to know where to start. However, by having a solid understanding of the basics and setting achievable goals, you can become a confident and successful coder.

Here are some tips from a begineer to help you get started:

1. Start with a programming language: [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="blank"} is a great first language to learn, as it has a simple syntax, is easy to read, and has a large community of users who can help you with any questions you may have.

2. Practice, practice, practice: As with any skill, the more you practice, the better you'll get. Start by working on small projects, and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.

3. Use online resources: There are many free online resources available that can help you learn coding, such as [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/){:target="blank"}, [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/){:target="blank"}, and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/){:target="blank"}. These resources provide interactive lessons, tutorials, and exercises that can help you develop your coding skills. I am  personally taking advantage of the benefits of online learning by studying through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/){:target="blank"} and [CodewithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry){:target="blank"}. These platforms provide me with a wealth of resources and opportunities to expand my coding knowledge and skills. The instructors on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/){:target="blank"} are highly experienced and the flexible scheduling allows me to study at my own pace. Meanwhile, [CodewithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com/){:target="blank"} provides hands-on coding practice and the chance to connect with a community of learners. By utilizing these resources, I am confident in my ability to continue my coding journey and achieve my goals.

4. Get involved with the community: Participating in online forums, attending meetups, and contributing to open source projects are all great ways to connect with other coders and learn from their experiences.

5. Learn [Git](https://github.com/){:target="blank"}: [Git](https://github.com/){:target="blank"} is a version control system that is widely used in the software development industry. Learning [Git](https://github.com/){:target="blank"} will help you keep track of your code and collaborate with others on projects.

6. In conclusion, becoming a coder takes time, patience, and practice, but it can be a rewarding experience. Whether you're looking to build your own software, develop websites, or simply learn a new skill, coding can open up a world of opportunities. So start small, set achievable goals, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Happy coding!"

> ### To know more and get started with Jekyll you can click [here](https://jekyllrb.com/){:targe="_blank"}
	
# Installation
**Jekyll is a Ruby Gem that can be installed on most systems.**
### Requirements
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/){:target="_blank"} version 2.5.0 or above, including all development headers (ruby version can be checked by running ruby -v)
* [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download){:target="_blank"} (which you can check by running gem -v)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/){:target="_blank"} and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/){:target="_blank"}

### After Installing the Requirements you can follow these guides:
**For detailed install instructions have a look at the guide for your operating system.**
* [macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/){:target="_blank"}
* [Other Linux Distros](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/other-linux/){:target="_blank"}
* [Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/){:target="_blank"}

### Creating a new Jekyll site
**We can create a new Jekyll site just by a simple command:**<br>
> # `jekyll new my-site`

Jekyll will create a new directory named as `my-site` which is customizable (i.e., you can change the name from `my-site` to anything you want for example `jekyll new brutus`).

### Changing into the Directory
**We have to go inside the directory:**<br>
> # `cd my-site`

Again, `my-site` is just a random name which is customizable.

### Building the site and making it available on a local server
> # `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Browsing your Jekyll site
> # Browse to [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/){:target="_blank"}
